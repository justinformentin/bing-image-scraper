# Bin Image Scraper

This project is just a test of a plain old python scraper.

Make sure you have requests installed
```
pip install requests
```
### image_single.py

In image_single.py you'll notice the lines to create a directory if one doesn't already exist. 

Just run
```
python image_single.py
```
and you will be prompted for your search term. A directory will then be created and the images will be placed there.

### image_loop.py

This loops through searches, and automatically creates a directory with the name of your search term.
```
python image_loop.py
```
